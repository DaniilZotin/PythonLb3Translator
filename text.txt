Python is good for all forms of programming, which makes its user base grow rapidly. Cross-platform shell scripting,
quick automation, simple web development, data analysis and visualization, AI and ML are some examples.
Often, specialists use Python to better perform a variety of tasks in different disciplines. Better performance,
among others, may be achieved with the help of automation. Finance, insurance, and marketing are the primary fields,
in which people face the necessity to do tasks that are repetitive and boring: viewing, copying, renaming, and uploading
files to a server, downloading websites or parsing data. Instead, a programmer can write a script in Python and automate it all.
Moreover, you should not necessarily be a software developer to use Python. The language allows facilitating data analysis and
visualization. It has a rich ecosystem comprising efficient libraries for data processing and therefore assisting data scientists
in performing complex numeric computing operations.
